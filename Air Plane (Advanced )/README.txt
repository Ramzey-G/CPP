Here's how the inhertance structure works:

A JetBlue Plane is derived from PlaneFlight. Header files declare specific attributes of each class
while cpp files describe them.

The Application file is the main program which allowes a user to: 
		  * check if plane is full
                  * check if plane is empty
                  * reserve a particular seat, if available
                  * reserve a seat furthest to the front
                  * reserve a seat furthest to the rear
                  * cancel a particular seat reservation
                  * print out all plane flight data
